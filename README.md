# Beginner developer quiz
To be honest, I fought very hard to create this simple project. I learned in more in-depth way how Python reads .txt files, how manipulate them, extracting its data.
In addition, one of the very challenges I had to face was iterating list of lists since it was my first time using them, but you know what the say: "Never stop learning!"
Last thing to say, I did not had that much joy creating the projecting since I had to ask rely on chatGPT several times, nevertheless, this is my first Python project so it is just matter of practise.
